need to make sure they cant end unless in bear off zone
need to make bot
need to add hole moves to valid moves in bot


make currentMarker in board do something. shoudl probably do stages of the game

there will be a state and a move that needs to be logged


a = learning rate


O(t+1) = O(t) + a f(t) e(t)        // delta + gradient

e(t) = delta et-1 + V(t)/delta(t)

f(t) = V(t)(st+1) - V(t)(st) if t<f
        z-V(t)(st)           if t=f


this uses temporal difference learning with back propogation

need to figure out utility
need to save the move correctly so it is passed around correctly

make sure move test the move of other player?

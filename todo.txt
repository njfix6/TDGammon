need to make sure they cant end unless in bear off zone
need to make bot
need to add hole moves to valid moves in bot

there will be a state and a move that needs to be logged


a = learning rate


O(t+1) = O(t) + a f(t) e(t)

e(t) = delta et-1 + V(t)/delta(t)

f(t) = V(t)(st+1) - V(t)(st) if t<f
        z-V(t)(st)           if t=f
